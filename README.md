log-file-search.py

>  A simple python program that will search a selected folder of Arma Reforger Server logs for a specific word or string.  For each string found, the entire line from the log will be exported to a results file.  This is great for quick searching of i.e., player logins for X day -- resulting in a single text file with all of the output.  Currently, this will only search for a single string each time.  Future updates will include searching for multiple strings ... and eventually developing a GUI for this, with a pull down menu of common searches (player logins, blue-on-blue, or a custom string.
